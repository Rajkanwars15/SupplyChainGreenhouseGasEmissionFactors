## About
The datasets are comprised of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors (Factors) for 1,016 U.S. commodities as defined by the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The Factors are based on GHG data representing 2019. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_CO2e_USD2021.csv) provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per USD for all GHGs combined using 100 yr global warming potentials from the 4th IPPC Assessment report to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors (SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_byGHG_USD2021.csv) provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar (USD) in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices in 2021 USD.
